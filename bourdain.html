                            <p>This is a map I created as a final project in my first cartography class. It is a
                                proportional symbol map of all the places Anthony Bourdain, a travel documentarian and
                                chef went to across his three different shows, No Reservations, The Layover, and Parts
                                Unknown. Because Bourdain was a world-renowned chef, I wanted the map to give an overall
                                feel of a menu with each continent as a menu item, and each place that has a description is a
                                different ingredient or element of the dish. I picked places to highlight from the
                                different shows based on how interesting the episode descriptions seemed and tried to be
                                consistent with the number of episodes I was highlighting across continents.
                                Furthermore, throughout the making of the map I made some important design choices, one
                                of which includes the halo surrounding each continent. Without the beige halo, the
                                continents fade into the background and do not bring the correct amount of emphasis to
                                the map as a whole. The transparency and colors of the proportional symbols were also
                                important to my design. I needed the symbols to be transparents the size contrast
                                between each different type of symbol was readily noticeable and the stark contrast
                                between colors were also very intentional because each show was very different from each
                                other and I wanted that to be reflected by varying hue and not value. Overall, I am
                                happy with the way the map turned out especially for someone just entering the world of
                                cartography.
