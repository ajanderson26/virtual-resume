            <p class="africatext">This map is a result of a political geography mapping challenge in my first
                cartography class. The goal of this assignment was to improve labeling skills by managing over 200
                labels. In this lab, I wanted to utilize Eduard Imhof guidelines for labeling by using labels to invoke
                the feature. This is why many labels of coastal features and countries have a slight curve to them. I
                also utilized the halo technique again in this map to use contrast as a way to show which labels were
                more important than others (such as country labels) and establish proper visual hierarchy. Lastly,
                leader lines were used to emphasize locational importance as well as create space for labels that would
                be improperly placed on the scale of visual hierarchy if no leader lines were used otherwise. I am proud
                of the way that this labeling challenge was completed although not without certain adjustments to use of
                color.</p>
